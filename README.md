ðŸš€ New Project Completed â€“ Quiz App ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™ve just built a Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was a great way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

âœ¨ Features:
âœ… Multiple-choice questions
âœ… Real-time answer selection & score tracking
âœ… Final score summary after completion
âœ… Reload button to restart the quiz
âœ… Clean, responsive UI with modern styling

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals such as:

Working with arrays & objects
Dynamically updating the DOM
Handling user input with event listeners

Excited to keep learning and working on more interactive web projects! ðŸ’»
